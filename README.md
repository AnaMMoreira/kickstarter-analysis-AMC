## **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Performing Analysis on Kickstarting data in order to uncover trends** 

  Louise, an up and coming Playwrite wants to start a crowd funding campaign to help fund her play "Fever".
She has asked for help analysing available data in order to identify trends that will help her set realistic 
budget goals and expectations in order to ensure a successful startup for her new play.  She has calculated her budget needs as follows.

She has estimated she will need a budget of aproximately $10,000.00 in order to fund the startup of her new play Ferver.

**Analysis and Challenges**

 The first step was to organize and sort crowd funding data available through filtering, formating and analizing the data in excel.
Analysis of trends and statistic calculations also prooved to be quite informative.
After sorting and formating the data in excel additional calculations allowed further inspection.
Using value shading the tabulated data can be quickly viewed and interpreted for how sucessful campaigns were or not.

Overall and preliminary data analysis determined that theater outcomes in the U.S. were more often successful that not and further 
filtering of this dataset revealed that the subcategory for Plays within the Theater market was even more often successful. 
This can be view in charts TheaterOutcomme-US and PlayOutcomme-US

Kickstarter project creators can add incentives for different pledge amounts. In order to help Louise set up her incentives,
determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically will be helpful.
A quick look at the average donation yielded the following table.

! [Table of Stats for U.S. Play Campaigns] (https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/cinzasdanjo-MRNbby/kickstarter-analysis-amc/-/blob/main/Stats_for_US_Campains.pdf)

**Observations**

Many of the successful campaigns satisfied the goal amount but the failed campains missed their goals by very a large margin.
Failed play campaigns had higher fundraising goals so the goals might have been set too high.  However, the pledge numbers were so low that 
they did not even come close to the goals of successful campaigns.  Suggesting that failure could not have been avoided but setting goals lower so something else impacted pledge received 
for the failed campaigns.

Furthermore, a look at Similar Plays in Great Britain can help solidify that sucessful campains met their targeted goals.  
However, it also by comparison, seems to point to an exagerated goal of $10,000 vs average goals that were closer to $2,000.
A sumary table of these Plays can be view in table Average Donation for Similar Projects in Great Britain.

This table also seems to suggest that the overall average donation for this type of project was $119.  that is a promissing number because 
it suggests Louise could successfully fund her project by motivating aproximatley 100 pleadges. The geographical location of the data however could 
render that conclusion null because there is no telling if U.S. funding would be so sucessful.

## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

A graphic interpretation of Outcomes Based on Goals depicted below suggests that as the Goal increases the rate of success decreases this would make sence that the more expensive or the larger the funding you need that harder it is to atain your goals. 
However, there seems to be a rise in sucess after a goal of $25,000 to $30,000 at which point it decreases again.  Another spike is observed at $40,000 which could be an outlier or perhaps suggesting unreliable data.
Another assumption is that the Goals is not a determining factor of success and something else is imfluencing the outcome.

## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

Since the previous data analysis resulted in the conclusion that the project is viable in the US and it may not be dependant on the Funding Goals a further look into the timing of the historical campains was worth the effort.
After sorting the data further to look at monthly trends of all Theater outcome data the following chart was generated. 
 
 ! [chart Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch] (https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/cinzasdanjo-MRNbby/kickstarter-analysis-amc/-/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

It can be seen that a seasonal pattern is suggested by this analysis and that perhaps campaigns launched after March through August might be more sucessful than during the winter months.  With the lowest sucessrates from November to March

If one was to take that data just a step further and normalise it to a percentages however, it can be deduced that the Seasonal patern is not as pronounced as it seemed.  Meaning that perhaps the seasonal pattern previously observed was a result of more campains being launched during the spring and summer times.

## **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

Challenges encountered were due to geographic differences in funding patterns and diversity in subcategories reduced the data to a much smaller dataset. 

## **Results**

### **- What can be concluded about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

In cloncusion, goals did not seem to affect the outcomes and other factors must be at play and influencing donations.


### **- What are two conclusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

Although a seasonal pattern seemed to be displayed and Sprin and Summer yeilded more numbers of successful campaigns, it turned out that those months had more campaign launches.
 When numbers of campains were normalized to a percentage number there seemed to be little fluctuation in sucess rates or failing rates for different months of the year except for December. 

### **- What are some limitations of this dataset?**

there seems to be perhaps some outliers and the geographic differences seems to be accentuated.  Perhaps people from different cultures and societies w different economic statusare motivated differently to fund cultural projects such as plays.
A data set more representative of the theater or play contributer may be helpful.  A geaographic look at cultural motivation and demographic data may also be helpful.  

### **- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created?**
 
- Further investigation of regional or geographic differences may be worth while if the data is available.

- Identification of outliers may also be helpful by looking at graphic statistical representations.

- further subcategories of "types of Plays" may also be a motivational factor for donations by conducting targeted surveys.
